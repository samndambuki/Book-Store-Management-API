Bookstore Management Store API 

Guidelines 

Project Name: Bookstore Management System API 

Description: Create a RESTful API for managing a bookstore's inventory and orders. This project will involve building endpoints to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books, customers, orders, and more. 

Guidelines: 

Database Schema: 

Design a database schema that includes tables for books, customers, orders, and order items. 

Use MySQL to store the data. 

User Registration and Authentication: 

Implement user registration and login functionality using JWT. 

Create roles (e.g., admin, employee) to control access to certain endpoints. 

Book Management: 

Create, retrieve, update, and delete books. 

Each book should have properties like title, author, price, quantity in stock, etc. 

Customer Management: 

Manage customer information (name, email, address). 

Create, retrieve, update, and delete customer records. 

Order Management: 

Allow customers to place orders for books. 

Store order details, including customer information and ordered items. 

Inventory Tracking: 

Implement logic to track available quantities of books. 

Ensure that stock is updated when orders are placed. 

Order History: 

Allow users to view their order history. 

Provide endpoints to retrieve orders based on filters like date range or status. 

Role-based Access Control: 

Admin users can manage books, customers, and orders. 

Regular users (customers) can view and place orders. 

Input Validation: 

Validate user input to ensure data integrity and prevent errors. 

Error Handling: 

Implement error handling middleware to provide informative error responses. 

Middleware: 

Implement authentication middleware to protect routes. 

Implement logging middleware to log requests and responses. 

Documentation: 

Document the API endpoints and their usage. 

This project will provide you with practical experience in creating a more complex API, handling different data entities, implementing role-based access control, managing inventory, and interacting with a database. It's a great way to enhance your skills in building real-world applications with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MySQL.
